## The Idea

For the Cutscene me and my group decided to make a fan made scene from the popular video game and film series Five Nights At Freddy's. The idea was to have a simple scene that relates partially to the game and movie but taking our own twist by creating events that aren't within these.

## Script Writing

*Figure 1* Shows the final script. Highlighted in red is ideas I made towards the script that was collectively liked by the group. In lesson there was a discussion about not changing the camera back into third person. I liked this idea and instead of the last part of the script I'll be making it so the child ducks and looks up to witness the fight.
# Extra Research

## Five Nights at Freddy's
Five Nights At Freddy's is a game, book and movie series. The original game came out in August 2014 being the first installment into the Freddy's universe. In the game you are a night guard looking to make a quick buck by looking after different sites from 12 to 6am. What isn't told is that Animatronics will hunt you down and try to kill you. Making it a task to survive the 6 hours. 
The story also delves into the history of freddy's where its found out a character called William Afton (yellow rabbit) has been killing children and stuffing them into suits to posses (Five Nights at Freddy’s, s.d.).
