## The Idea

For the Cutscene me and my group decided to make a fan made scene from the popular video game and film series Five Nights At Freddy's. The idea was to have a simple scene that relates partially to the game and movie but taking our own twist by creating events that aren't within these.

## Script Writing

*Figure 1* Shows the final script. Highlighted in red is ideas I made towards the script that was collectively liked by the group. In lesson there was a discussion about not changing the camera back into third person. I liked this idea and instead of the last part of the script I'll be making it so the child ducks and looks up to witness the fight.

*Figure 3* Shows a Party room in Five Nights At Freddy's 2, This design is something similar to what I would like to recreate for my cutscene (Party Room 1, 2025).

Five Nights At Freddy's is a game, book and movie series. The original game came out in August 2014 being the first installment into the Freddy's universe. In the game you are a night guard looking to make a quick buck by looking after different sites from 12 to 6am. What isn't told is that Animatronics will hunt you down and try to kill you (Five Nights at Freddy’s, s.d.). Making it a task to survive the 6 hours.

The story also delves into the history of freddy's where its found out a character called William Afton (yellow rabbit (Spring Bonnie | Five Nights at Freddy’s Wiki | Fandom, s.d.)) has been killing children and stuffing them into suits to posses (William Afton (Film), 2025). In the second film there is a puppet called Marionette that protects children and defends them from harm (The Puppet, s.d.).
