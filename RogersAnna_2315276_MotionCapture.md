## The Idea

For the Cutscene me and my group decided to make a fan made scene from the popular video game and film series Five Nights At Freddy's. The idea was to have a simple scene that relates partially to the game and movie but taking our own twist by creating events that aren't within these.

## Script Writing

![IMG-20251210-WA0045](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/355052a7-7116-492d-b96f-a32403ae035b)

*Figure 1* Shows the final script. Highlighted in red is ideas I made towards the script that was collectively liked by the group. In lesson there was a discussion about not changing the camera back into third person. I liked this idea and instead of the last part of the script I'll be making it so the child ducks and looks up to witness the fight.

## Five Nights at Freddy's

*Figure 3* Shows a Party room in Five Nights At Freddy's 2, This design is something similar to what I would like to recreate for my cutscene (Party Room 1, 2025).

Five Nights At Freddy's is a game, book and movie series. The original game came out in August 2014 being the first installment into the Freddy's universe. In the game you are a night guard looking to make a quick buck by looking after different sites from 12 to 6am. What isn't told is that Animatronics will hunt you down and try to kill you (Five Nights at Freddy’s, s.d.). Making it a task to survive the 6 hours.

*Figure 4 and 5* Shows the images of two main characters that we will be using for the cutscene, on the left is the Yellow Rabbit and the right the Puppet.

The story also delves into the history of freddy's where its found out a character called William Afton (yellow rabbit (Spring Bonnie | Five Nights at Freddy’s Wiki | Fandom, s.d.)) has been killing children and stuffing them into suits to posses (William Afton (Film), 2025). In the second film there is a puppet called Marionette that protects children and defends them from harm (The Puppet, s.d.).


## Shot Breakdown

For this work we had to plan and prepare for the Mocap shoot, this included preparing props, deciding who was taking what role and what needed to be shot.

Using Excel, we filled out a Mocap planning sheet to plan what was gonna be shot, who was in the shots and how many shots needed to be taken. We also used a template provided to us to make a shot breakdown on word, this could also be printed for the shoot day.

## Mocap Shoot

For the Moacp shoot we managed to shoot everything needed and more, We were left alone for the shoot after the setup was complete and shot several shoots of every scene to make sure there was enough.

I was on the computers naming the files, starting and stopping the shoot and playing the clips back for the actors to see.

*Figure 10* Shows the Actors having fun together at the bottom, the top image shows an actor stretching while her suit was calibrating, we had to make sure each marker was around 40% before we stopped it.
